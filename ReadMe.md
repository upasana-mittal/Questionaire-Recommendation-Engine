# Questionare Recommendation Engine

Recommendation Engine

Recommending the questions that a programmer should solve given his/her current expertise is a big challenge for Online Judge Platforms but is an essential task to keep a programmer engaged on their platform.

In this practice problem, you are given the data of programmers and questions that they have previously solved along with the time that they took to solve that particular question.

As a data scientist, your task is to build a model that can predict the time taken to solve a problem given the user current status.

This model will help online judges to decide the next level of questions to recommend to a user.
